Below is the project description. It is what I am aiming for.

Water temp in to the water to air handler
Water temp out of the water to air handler
Water temp in to the water to water handler
Water temp out of the water to water handler
Water temp in to the manifold for the floor
Water temp out of the manifold to the floor
Water temp in to the water heater
Water temp out of the water heater
Outside air temp
Plenum air temp
Water flow through the water to air handler
Water flow through the water to water handler

I would like to store this data in some sort of way to be able to review it over time.  I suspect you will want a data base but the amount of data should be minimal.   Probably less than 50 GB.  Each record in the DB is pretty small.   Such as - 

1.  How much water do I expect to use the the outside air temp reaches 40 degrees farenhight.
2.  How much water did we use in the water to air handler last month
3.  What was the total amount of water that flowed through the water to water unit last year
4.  Did we use more water in 2021 or 2022

Later on, I might want to use the relays that I purchased to create the following logic.  

1.  If the water to air handler is running, don’t let the water to water unit run.
2.  If the incoming water temp is < 38 degrees, don’t let any of the units run.

Not sure how you will present this data to me, in a web form, or some sort of SQL query.
